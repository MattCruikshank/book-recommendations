My book recommendations

## Sci-Fi

* "The Martian" by Andy Weir
* "Daemon" and "Freedom" by Daniel Suarez - a techno-thriller series about a computer virus that takes over the world
* "Empire from the Ashes" by David Webber
* "A Fire Upon the Deep" by Vernor Vinge - DO NOT READY ANY DESCRIPTION OF THIS BOOK
* "On Basilisk Station (Honor Harrington Book 1)" by David Webber - each book feels like a long episode of Star Trek : The Next Generation, but with a focus on combat
* "Reamde" by Neil Stephenson
* "Ready Player One" by Ernest Cline - light, silly pulp 80s nostalgia in a fast-paced book
* "Fool's War" by Sarah Zettel (for whatever reason, I don't like any of her other books)
* "The Golden Age," "The Phoenix Exultant," and "The Golden Transcendence" by John C. Wright.  When people talk about "World Building" in books, nothing comes close to this.  10,000 years in the future.  I hate the politics of the author, but I love this series of books.

## Fantasy

* The "Mistborn" series of books (on Kindle, you can buy the entire series in one book) by Brandon Sanderson
* The "Stormlight Archive" series of books, starting with "The Way of Kings" by Brandon Sanderson
* "The Name of the Wind" by Patrick Rothfuss
* "Paternus: Rise of Gods" by Dyrk Ashton - not great, but fun
* "Oath of Swords" by David Webber
* "Cradle" series by Will Wight - very light, but fun
